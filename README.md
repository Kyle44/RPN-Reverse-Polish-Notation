# RPN-Reverse-Polish-Notation-
A calculator that works in RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).  It requires a space after every character input.  The calculator can calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Example input would be: 4 4 + 4 * 2 -             This is the same as 4 + 4  * 4 - 2 in regular notation.  This would output 30.  It doesn't follow the order of operations.
